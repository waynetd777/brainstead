summary: Set up the Outlook and Teams browser extensions that capture emails, chats and transcripts into the vault.
---
Two browser extensions send what's open in Outlook on the web or Teams into the vault's `sources/` folder, ready to ingest and listed in the [Inbox](app:inbox). They reach Brainstead through a small helper the browser starts, so they work while Brainstead is closed.

## What each extension captures
- **Outlook capture**: the open email thread in Outlook on the web, or the threads ticked in the list.
- **Teams capture**: the open Teams chat or channel thread, or a meeting's transcript, named with the day of the meeting when the recap page shows it.

Captures are refused while the vault is read-only; turn that off in [Settings › Vault](app:settings/vault).

## Install the extensions
1. In Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi or Chromium, open `chrome://extensions` and switch on Developer mode.
2. Click Load unpacked and choose an extension's folder. **Show in Finder** on its row shows the folder.
3. Pin the extension to the toolbar.
4. Open an email thread or a Teams chat and click the extension's button.

After Brainstead is updated, open this page (it refreshes the extensions' folder) and click the reload button on the extension's card in `chrome://extensions`. There's nothing to copy or paste. The line under the steps lists the browsers that can reach Brainstead; if none is listed, install one of them and open this page again.

## Check recent captures
**Recent captures** lists what arrived, or what was refused and why. **Open** opens a captured source. To ingest each one as it arrives, switch on **Ingest new sources as they arrive** in [Settings › AI assistants](app:settings/assistants).

## Quick capture lives elsewhere
The `⌃⌥Space` capture box doesn't need the browser; see [Quick capture](help:capture).
