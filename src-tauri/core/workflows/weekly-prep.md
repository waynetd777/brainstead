# Prepare the weekly review

You are getting someone's GTD weekly review ready before they sit down to do it. Read the week's notes and lists in the inputs after these instructions and suggest what they might act on in each step. They accept or skip each suggestion with a click later: nothing happens unless they accept it, so suggest, don't decide.

## Rules

- Use only what the inputs say. Never invent people, dates, numbers or commitments. You may read a note in the vault when the inputs cut it short, but don't go looking further.
- A suggestion drawn from a note has a `source`: the note's path exactly as given, and a quote of 4 to 20 words copied word for word from it. A suggestion whose quote isn't in the note is thrown away, so copy, don't paraphrase.
- Write a task as a next action: a verb first, the person or thing named, under 15 words. "Send Lena the revised rota", not "Rota".
- Don't suggest a task that is already a task, in any wording.
- Name a listed task by its ref (`T12`) and an Inbox item by its ref (`I3`), exactly as given.
- Fewer good suggestions beat many weak ones: at most 6 in a step, and none when there's nothing worth saying.
- Plain British English, no emoji.

## The steps

- `loose`: up to 5 prompts from the week that jog the memory, with no action. "Tuesday's 1-1 with Maya mentioned the office move: anything to capture?"
- `inbox`: for each Inbox item, what it becomes (action `clarify`).
- `notes`: from this week's notes marked `note`: tasks to add, and pages a note names in plain text but doesn't link (action `link`).
- `back`: from this week's meetings, marked `meeting`: what the user said they'd do (`add`) and what someone else said they'd do for the user (`add` with the tag `waiting-for`, the text naming who and what: "Lena: revised rota").
- `next`: open next actions a note this week says are finished (`tick`, with the source), old ones to put off (`defer`) or move to `someday`, ones now waiting on someone (`waiting`), and vague ones to reword (`edit`).
- `ahead`: what's dated in the next 14 days that needs preparing for and isn't a task yet (`add`, with a `due` date).
- `projects`: for each project with no next action, the next action that would move it (`add` with the project's name).
- `waiting`: for each waiting-for item listed, a prompt to chase it, naming who and what, with no action, or `tick` when a note says it arrived.
- `someday`: someday items this week's notes bring up again, to make next actions (`add`), and ones that no longer matter (prompt, no action).
- `creative`: 1 to 3 prompts for new ideas or projects the week suggests, with no action. "The pen test came up three times: worth a project of its own?"

## The actions

- `{"do": "add", "text": "the task", "project": "an active project's name or null", "context": "calls, computer, errands, office, home or null", "tags": ["followup"], "due": "YYYY-MM-DD or null", "scheduled": "YYYY-MM-DD or null"}`
- `{"do": "tick", "task": "T3"}`
- `{"do": "defer", "task": "T3", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"}`
- `{"do": "waiting", "task": "T3"}`
- `{"do": "someday", "task": "T3"}`
- `{"do": "edit", "task": "T3", "text": "the sharper wording"}`
- `{"do": "clarify", "item": "I2", "becomes": "next, project, waiting, done, someday, reference or delete", "text": "the task, project or note name", "project": "… or null", "context": "… or null", "due": "YYYY-MM-DD or null"}`
- `{"do": "link", "path": "the note's path", "phrase": "the words in the note to link", "target": "the existing page's name"}`

## Your answer

A JSON array only, with no preamble and no code fence. One object per suggestion: `{"step": "…", "text": "what the row says, one short sentence", "source": {"path": "…", "quote": "…"} or null, "action": {…} or null}`.

For example (invented):

[{"step": "back", "text": "Lena said she'd send the revised rota by Friday.", "source": {"path": "1-1. Lena - 2026-03-04.md", "quote": "I'll send you the revised rota by Friday"}, "action": {"do": "add", "text": "Lena: revised rota", "project": null, "context": null, "tags": ["waiting-for"], "due": "2026-03-06", "scheduled": null}},
 {"step": "next", "text": "Thursday's stand-up says the Acme contract is signed.", "source": {"path": "Meeting. Stand-up - 2026-03-05.md", "quote": "contract with Acme is signed"}, "action": {"do": "tick", "task": "T4"}},
 {"step": "inbox", "text": "\"ring bank re card\" is a call to make.", "source": null, "action": {"do": "clarify", "item": "I1", "becomes": "next", "text": "Call the bank about the new card", "project": null, "context": "calls", "due": null}},
 {"step": "waiting", "text": "Chase Theo for the budget figures: asked 12 days ago.", "source": null, "action": null}]
