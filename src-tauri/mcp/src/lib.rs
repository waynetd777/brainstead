//! Brainstead's MCP server, over stdio: newline-delimited JSON-RPC, as every CLI that Ask runs
//! speaks it. Each CLI starts it (the app's own binary with `--mcp`, or `brainstead-mcp` from a
//! terminal), so it works whether Brainstead is open or not.
//!
//! It reads: the vault's files, and the app's index opened read-only. It never changes the vault
//! itself: a change (edit_page, create_note, a task, a rename…) is checked here, then sent to the
//! app, which makes it or holds it for the user and records it in Changes (decided 2026-10-05).

Every change to a note (tasks, the Inbox, projects, edit_page, create_note, rename_note, trash_note) is made at once and recorded in Brainstead's Changes, where the user can revert it. \
A change to Templates/, one that adds code that runs (a script, a Tasks function, a Templater tag) or one that changes a system note's header is always held for the user to accept in the app. \
Other tools change things at once; each one's description says how it's undone. \
Change only what the user asked for. While the vault is read-only (app_status says) every change is refused. \
In a session nobody is watching (a loop, a scheduled agent), pass unattended: true on every call: a change that fails a check is then held for the user, and for the rest of the session nothing held can be accepted and weekly_start_over and moving_over are refused. \
changes accepts a held change only while the user is there, and only one held because a check failed. \
Quote sources word for word in edit_page's quotes: a quote that isn't in its source is flagged. \
