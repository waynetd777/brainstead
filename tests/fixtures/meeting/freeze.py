"""Runs the previous app's infer_meeting.py over the file names in cases.json and freezes its answers.

    python3 tests/fixtures/meeting/freeze.py <path to the previous app's scripts/>

The script's owner is set to the cases' owner, and its vault is a temp folder holding the cases'
notes. The output is expected.json, which src-tauri/core/src/meeting.rs compares against; run
Prettier on it afterwards. Invented names only.
