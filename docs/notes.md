## A note

<a href="images/index.md#notes"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/note-dark.png"><img alt="A meeting note in View: properties, actions as tasks, and the side pane with Linked from, open tasks and the outline" src="images/note-light.png"></picture></a>

A note has three modes:

- **View** (⌘1) shows it rendered: properties, links, tables, tasks, callouts, diagrams and maths.
- **Edit** (⌘2) is the markdown, with the syntax hidden except on the lines you're on.
- **Source** (⌘3) is the plain markdown in a monospaced font, with no toolbar.

Beside the note are **Linked from** (every note that links here, with the line), its **open tasks** to tick, and its **outline**. On a 1-1 note, **Last time with** shows the previous 1-1 and the follow-ups still open with that person.

The top bar has **Ask** (a chat about this note), a bookmark, **Copy** (markdown, rich text, path or title), **Rename…** (⇧⌘R, rewriting every link to the note), **Graph** and **Focus mode** (⌘., Esc leaves it). The **Note** menu has most of these. **Export PDF…** (⌘P) writes the note in its look, with page numbers. Each note can have its own look (Brainstead, Business, Editorial, Modern, Minimal, Report or Technical), colour, and light or dark.

## Read aloud

<a href="images/index.md#notes"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/read-aloud-dark.png"><img alt="A wiki page being read aloud: the word being said highlighted, and the player bar at the foot of the page" src="images/read-aloud-light.png"></picture></a>

Click the speaker on the top bar, or press ⇧⌘P, to hear the note or wiki page in macOS's voices. Each word is highlighted as it's said. Space plays and pauses; Esc stops. Choose the voice and speed in Settings › Notes.

## Writing

<a href="images/index.md#notes"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/editor-dark.png"><img alt="The same note in Edit, with the formatting toolbar and the markdown shown as you'd read it" src="images/editor-light.png"></picture></a>

- The toolbar formats text, lists, tasks, quotes, code, tables, links and images, and inserts today's date or a query.
- `[[` links a note and `#` adds a tag. Both are suggested as you type part of a name: `[[` alone lists your newest notes, and `#calls` finds `#context/calls`. ⌘-click a link to open it.
- Paste or drop an image to save it in `images/` and embed it. In Edit, hover it to resize by a corner (written as `![[pic.png|400]]`) or remove it from the note; the file stays. Double-click an image to edit its markdown.
- Click an image in View, or its expand button in Edit, to see it fitted to the window. Click for actual size; Escape closes it.
- In a task, `due:`, `defer:`, `start:` and `created:` followed by a word (tomorrow, fri, +3d) become dates. A date picker opens when you type the colon.
- Spelling and grammar are checked as you type, in the English you choose.
- ⌘F finds, and in Edit and Source replaces, one match or all.

**New note** (⌘N) names the note from its type, title and date (`Meeting. Orbit App Steerco - 2026-09-30.md`), or makes it from a template.

## Saving and drafts

⌘S saves, and never reformats what you didn't change. Leaving a note with unsaved changes asks first.

- Unsaved text is kept as a draft a second after you stop typing. If the app quits, opening the note again offers it back.
- If another app changed the file meanwhile, changes on other lines are merged in. Changes on the same lines show a banner with **Reload**, **Keep mine** and **Compare** (which marks the lines that differ). Nothing is overwritten.

## Queries, callouts and diagrams

- **Tasks queries** (`tasks` blocks) and **Dataview** (`dataview` blocks: TABLE, LIST, TASK and CALENDAR) run in View, with tasks you can tick. In Edit, the editor suggests what comes next, and **Build query…** opens a builder with a live preview.
- **Callouts** (`> [!tip] Title`) are tinted boxes with an icon; `[!tip]-` or `[!tip]+` makes them fold.
- **Mermaid** diagrams, with pan, zoom and a full-screen button (Escape closes it).
- **KaTeX** maths (`$…$` and `$$…$$`); an amount like $5 isn't taken for maths.
- Highlighted code, and `==highlights==` in colours.

Plain queries work in every note. Scripts in queries (`dataviewjs` blocks, inline `$=` and Tasks' `filter by function`) run only in your own notes. They don't run in sources, wiki pages, templates, saved chats, the summary notes or notes an assistant wrote. Delete `created-by: assistant` from a note an assistant wrote to trust it.

## Templates

A template turns a routine into one click. A 1-1 template can ask who it's with, file the note under their name and date, and pull in every open follow-up tagged for them. A weekly plan can lay out the days ahead and what's due in each.

Inside a `<% %>` tag the editor suggests `tp` functions with their arguments, `moment` dates and your own names, each explained with a link to its docs. Hover over a name to see what it does.

Templates are the files in `Templates/`, written in Templater's syntax: prompts and pick lists, dates, file names, properties, includes and your own scripts in `Templates/scripts`. Its questions are asked in the New note dialog. **Test run** shows what it would make without writing anything.

A new vault comes with example templates: Meeting, Daily note (date offsets and an include), 1-1 (a pick list and a `#followup` task), Project, Weekly plan (a loop and a user script) and Reading note (properties and a move to a folder). **Settings › Vault › Add the example notes** adds any that are missing.

## Finding things

<a href="images/index.md#notes"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/search-dark.png"><img alt="Search: results with their best passage and the matches marked, the layer chips, the date range and saved searches" src="images/search-light.png"></picture></a>

- **⌘K** finds notes, wiki pages, sources, open tasks, screens and commands from any screen, with **Search everything**, **Ask** and **Capture … as a task**.
- **Search** (⌘⇧F) searches the text of every note, wiki page and source. Words match in any form. `+word`, `-word`, `"exact phrase"`, `tag:hiring`, `since:2026-09` and `before:2026-10-01` narrow it. Choose the layers, a date range and the order. **Save search** keeps one under Saved searches, where its x deletes it.
- **Notes**, **Wiki** and **Sources** list their files, sorted and filtered as you type. Notes can also be grouped by type.

## System notes

Some notes are Brainstead's own: the To Do list, the Scratchpad, bookmarks, saved searches, the canonical docs register, the daily and weekly summaries, `CLAUDE.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`, and any note that opens with a **This is a system note** callout. Other features rely on them:

- They can't be renamed or moved to the Trash, from the app or by an assistant.
- The header callout is locked in the editor. Edit freely below it.
- If the header goes missing or changes, Knowledge health flags it. Its safe fix puts back the last header Brainstead saw.
- An assistant's change to the header is always held for you in Changes, and only you can accept it.

Other apps can still change these files.

## The Trash

Moving a note to the Trash puts it in the vault's `.trash` folder, with Undo. The Trash screen lists and searches what's there, puts files back where they were, and deletes them for good.
