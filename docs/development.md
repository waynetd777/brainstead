# Development

Tauri 2: a React 19 and TypeScript frontend (Vite), a Rust backend.

| Folder | Holds |
|---|---|
| `src-tauri/core/` (`brainstead-core`) | Vault parsing, SQLite index and search, tasks, safe writes, agent changes, ingest, reviews, Knowledge health. No Tauri |
| `src-tauri/mcp/` (`brainstead-mcp`) | The MCP server |
| `src-tauri/src/` | The app: commands, watcher, jobs, menu bar, MCP actions bridge; OS-specific code in `platform/` |
| `src-tauri/evals/` | Workflows run against real models |
| `src/` | The frontend |

The finished build plan is untracked in `archive/`. Decisions: `_sift/decisions.jsonl`, read with `python3 _sift/bin/sift.py decisions`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make dev` | Run with hot reload (Vite on localhost:1440) |
| `make help` | List the targets |
| `make check` | In parallel: Rust tests and Clippy (core, MCP, app), TypeScript check, ESLint, Vitest, formatting and repo checks (`tools/check.py`; `python3 tools/check.py rust` runs one group). Builds into `src-tauri/target/check`, so `make dev` doesn't block it. ~15 s warm, minutes cold |
| `make test` | Same as `make check` |
| `make lint` | Checks only: rustfmt, Clippy (warnings are errors), Prettier, ESLint, stylelint, ruff, licence headers, button tooltips |
| `make fmt` | Reformat everything; add missing licence headers |
| `make evals` | Workflow evals with real models on a copy of the fixture vault (`EVALS="help --model …"` picks); writes `src-tauri/target/evals/report.md`. Not in `check` |
| `make app` | Bump the version and build the .app, signed with `signing.local`'s identity if present |
| `make install-app` | Build at the current version (no bump) and replace the copy in /Applications, quitting Brainstead first |
| `make dmg` | Pack the app into `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Brainstead.dmg` |
| `make screenshots` | Retake `docs/images/` |
| `make icons` | Redraw the icon artwork and regenerate the icon set |
| `make sign-check` | Show the installed app's signer; fail unless it's `signing.local`'s identity |

- `make check` must pass before every commit.
- Quit the installed Brainstead before `make dev` if they share an app data folder, or both run the scheduled jobs. `BRAINSTEAD_DATA` separates them.
- Tests copy `tests/fixtures/vault/` to a temp folder; never a real vault.
- Capture extensions: Vitest tests sit beside their pure functions (`extensions/**/*.test.js`), run by `make check`. Bump `manifest.json`'s version on any change; users reload via Settings › Capture extensions and `chrome://extensions`.
- Evals default to cheap models (Haiku under test, Sonnet judging); ingest scenarios need and name Sonnet.

Releasing: `make app`, `make dmg`, commit and push, then `gh release create v<version> src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Brainstead.dmg`. Keep the name `Brainstead.dmg`: the README links to it. `tools/dmg/make_dmg.py` renders the background from `tools/dmg/background.html` (WebKit) and has Finder lay out the icons, so the first run asks to let the terminal control Finder.

## Rules

`CLAUDE.md` has the full list. In short:

- The vault is the only source of truth and other apps edit it. Never reformat markdown the user didn't change. Writes are atomic and refuse if the file changed since read.
- No model writes to the vault directly: changes go through the app (`src-tauri/src/changes.rs`) and are recorded in Changes. User-started ones apply at once. Held: a scheduled change that fails a check, anything touching `Templates/` (renames and trashes too), runnable code, a system note's header.
- OS-specific code stays in `src-tauri/src/platform/`, for Windows and Linux.
- Same change as the behaviour: `docs/`, `README.md`, the screen's help (`src/help/*.md`) and MCP support.
- Invented names only (Orbit App, Maya, Lena, Acme…) in fixtures, docs, comments and UI text.

## Writing the docs

These pages are the user guide; the in-app help goes deeper per screen. Say what a feature does, how to use it, the keys. Short sentences, plain British English, one `##` per topic, invented names in examples.

## Where things live

In `~/Library/Application Support/Brainstead/`, or `BRAINSTEAD_DATA`.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Settings | `settings.json` |
| Index (SQLite, FTS5), rebuilt when its schema changes | `index.db` |
| Drafts, undo, extracted PDF and Office text | `drafts/`, `undo.json`, `text/` |
| Agent changes; texts before and after, compressed. Kept 90 days or 500 MB (Settings › AI assistants) | `changes/<id>.json`, `changes/text/` |
| The old review queue, moved in once, kept one release | `proposals-backup/` |
| Runs: ingest, daily and weekly summaries, daily check, contradictions, Write Current state | `runs/`, `summaries/`, `daily-check.json`, `contradictions/`, `current-state.json` |
| Knowledge health: not-duplicates, daily counts | `health.json` |
| Weekly review in progress | `weekly.json` |
| Weekly review's prepared suggestions (by week) and runs | `weekly-prep/` |
| Unsaved chats; saved chats' turns while read-only (by vault name); Antigravity's working folder | `chats/`, `chats-pending/`, `ask/agy/` |
| Capture extensions' copy for Show in Finder | `extensions/` |
| Latest browser captures (watched) | `captures.json` |
| Captures waiting in the Inbox | `captures-inbox.json` |
| Captures already clarified | `inbox-captures.json` |
| Fix name's corrections | `substitutions.json` |
| Find tasks and projects: suggestions, accepted or skipped, last run | `find/state.json` |
| When each bookmark was last kept in triage | `bookmarks-kept.json` |
| Your tools that start Claude Code sessions, excluded from summaries (Settings › Jobs & schedule) | `summaries/automated.json` |
| MCP actions waiting for the app | `bridge/` |
| Logs | `logs/` |

## The MCP server

The app binary with `--mcp` is the MCP server (Ask adds `--data <folder>`, `--chat <id>`, `--model <id>`): newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio, protocol 2024-11-05 to 2025-06-18. `brainstead-mcp` also builds standalone. For Claude Code (Settings › AI assistants has Codex, Copilot and Antigravity's commands):

```sh
claude mcp add -s user brainstead -- "/Applications/Brainstead.app/Contents/MacOS/Brainstead" --mcp
```

- It reads the vault from disk and the index read-only, and writes nothing. A change (`edit_page`, `create_note`, a task, a rename…) is checked, then sent to the app as `change.submit`, which applies or holds it.
- Other actions (ticking a task, clarifying the Inbox, starting a run, reverting) are request files in `bridge/`. The app hands them to the window, which runs the screens' own functions (`src/mcpActions.ts`), so undo, `log.md`, read-only and Templater behave as on screen.
- It opens the app if it isn't running.
- Tools have titles and the four MCP hints. Reads are separate tools marked read-only (`list_changes` beside `changes`, `list_trash` beside `restore_from_trash`…), so clients can run them unasked. A read tool sends its change tool's app action, limited to the read actions in `acting`.
- Unknown tool: JSON-RPC error. Bad arguments or an impossible action: tool error (`isError`) saying why, so the model can retry. 120 calls a minute.
- Listing tools have an `outputSchema` and return rows as `structuredContent` too: the action returns `listed(...)`'s `{ text, structured }` and `act` passes both on. `search`, `list_projects`, `list_changes`, `activity` and `graph` give one line per row unless `detail`.
- Tests check the instructions stay under 2,000 characters (Claude Code keeps no more) and every parameter has a description.
- A new screen action needs an action in `src/mcpActions.ts`, a tool in `src-tauri/mcp/src/lib.rs` and its name in `ask::MCP_TOOLS` (`src-tauri/core/src/ask.rs`). A test in `src-tauri/mcp` keeps the tools and that list in step.

## Read aloud

Uses macOS's AVSpeechSynthesizer, not WebKit's `speechSynthesis`, which hides downloaded Premium and Enhanced voices and pauses unreliably.

- `src-tauri/src/platform/speech.rs`: the synthesiser, on the main thread, delegate kept alive (it holds it weakly).
- `src-tauri/src/speech.rs`: `tts_*` commands, synchronous so a stop and the next speak arrive in order.
- `src/speech/player.ts`: each utterance's id is its generation; older ones are ignored. Holds a paused utterance and remembers the next block if a pause lands at a block's end. Says title and date first and "That concludes …" last, outside the word positions so the highlight skips them.
- `src/speech/blocks.ts`: spoken text and the highlight's character map in one walk of the rendered note (UTF-16 offsets both ends).
- `platform/now_playing.rs`: media keys via Now Playing, cleared on stop. `caffeinate` keeps the screen awake while playing.
- `src/speech/*.test.*`: extraction and playback races, with a fake synthesiser.

## Signing and permissions

Ad-hoc builds lose Full Disk Access on every rebuild. To fix:

1. Create a self-signed code-signing certificate named `Brainstead Dev` (see `signing.local.example`). One per app.
2. Copy `signing.local.example` to `signing.local` (untracked) and put the certificate's name in it.
3. Give the installed app Full Disk Access once.

Open at login works only in the installed app, not `make dev`.

## Help

The `?` drawer's topics are `src/help/*.md`: one per screen and Settings pane, plus getting-started guides and the keyboard list. The window imports them and Rust embeds them (`core/build.rs`), so Ask answers from the same text via the MCP `help` tool. `src/help/help.test.ts` checks every screen has a topic, links resolve to real screens, and there are no emoji or real names.

A new vault's example notes are in `src-tauri/starter-vault/`, embedded the same way (`core/src/starter.rs`). `{{date}}`, `{{date+N}}`, `{{date-N}}` and `{{now}}` in a name or text become dates when written, so example tasks aren't overdue. Tests check each example says it's one and every link resolves.

## Screenshots

`make screenshots` retakes every scene in `tools/screenshots/scenes.json`, in both themes. Needs Pillow.

- Demo data is in `.demo/` (gitignored): the fixture vault plus a few files. The app's home is the demo's, so paths show as `~/Notes` and nothing outside `.demo/` is touched.
- `--fresh` remakes the demo; `--docs` takes only docs scenes; `-j N` runs N apps at once (default 4, each with its own demo app data); `--release` uses `make app`'s build, for release-only behaviour (its Content Security Policy).
- A scene's `caret` puts the editor caret at `|` in the text; `hover` rests the mouse there. For checking editor popups.
- `BRAINSTEAD_SCENE` is screenshot mode: the window is invisible and unfocused, so nothing flashes, yet WebKit still runs animation frames and CodeMirror popups. Text in images isn't read (kept text is reused). The webview snapshot is saved to the file in `BRAINSTEAD_SNAPSHOT`.
- The script redraws the window buttons and rounded corners, and keeps a shot only when it matches the saved image or a second capture a few seconds later; otherwise it retakes it.
- `"docs": true` scenes go to `docs/images/` (committed); others to `tools/screenshots/out/` (not). `"width"` keeps a scene's size (the menu-bar window is 720, its natural 2×).
- Docs show each screenshot in the reader's theme via `<picture>`, linked to `docs/images/index.md`, which lists them all. A new docs screenshot needs `"docs": true` and a line there.
