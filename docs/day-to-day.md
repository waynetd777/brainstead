# Day to day

Brainstead keeps working while its window is closed: Quick capture, captures from the browser, the daily and weekly summaries and the daily check all run from the menu bar.

## The menu bar

<a href="images/index.md#day-to-day"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/tray-dark.png"><img alt="The menu-bar window: one task overdue, the counts, the capture box, what waits for you, and the menu" src="images/tray-light.png" width="360"></picture></a>

Brainstead's menu-bar icon shows three dots while a run is going, and a dot when something waits for you: an overdue task, changes held for you, or items in the Inbox. Click it for:

- A headline: **All clear**, **Things need you**, runs going, or what couldn't load. A **Read-only** pill shows while the vault is read-only and opens Settings › Vault. **Overdue**, **Due today** and **Waiting for** counts open Today.
- A capture box, the same as Quick capture.
- Each run that's going (an ingest, a summary, the daily check, Find tasks and projects and so on), with its progress and **Stop**.
- Changes held for you and items in the Inbox, each opening its screen.
- **Open Brainstead** (⌘O), **Today** (⌘T), **Ask** (⌘J), **Run the daily check now**, **Settings…** (⌘,) and **Quit Brainstead** (⌘Q).

Turn on **Open at login** (in Settings › General or the menu-bar window) and **Only in the menu bar when the window is closed** (Settings › General), and Brainstead starts when you log in and stays out of the Dock until you open its window.

## Summaries and jobs

<a href="images/index.md#day-to-day"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/settings-jobs-dark.png"><img alt="Settings › Jobs & schedule: the daily and weekly summaries, the daily check and recent runs" src="images/settings-jobs-light.png"></picture></a>

In Settings › Jobs & schedule:

- **Daily summary** and **Weekly summary**: a model writes a summary of the day's or week's notes, tasks and Claude Code sessions. A note with a day in its name, such as a meeting note, counts on that day, however late it was written. **Run now** can redo a past day (pick it in **for**). The summary goes at the top of the month's summaries note, undoable, or waits in Changes if **Hold the summaries for me** is on. Each runs as a chat in Ask, in a tab marked with a calendar. (The weekly summary isn't the Weekly review, which you do yourself.)
- **Prepare the weekly review**: 4 hours before the review, a model reads the week and suggests actions for each step of the [weekly review](tasks.md). Nothing changes until you accept one. It has its own switch, **Run now** and **Stop**, and runs on schedule only while Brainstead runs the summaries.
- To use these, turn on **Brainstead runs the daily and weekly summaries**, and switch them off in any other app that writes them.
- **Daily check**: looks for contradictions in wiki pages that changed, updates the list of pages in `index.md`, and counts pages edited out of shape (for Knowledge health's Reshape pages). It can also re-ingest sources that changed (a switch under Ingest in Settings › AI assistants).
- **Recent runs**, with **Open**, **Show** and **Undo**; the Daily, Weekly and Daily check rows have **Stop** while one runs.

The summaries split what you did into **Work done** and **Personal** by your projects' areas: a project in the area Personal is personal, any other is work, done projects included. A Claude Code session whose folder is named after a project counts for it (`orbit-app` is Orbit App).

A run missed while the Mac slept catches up when Brainstead next runs.

To keep sessions started by your own tools (a script, another app) out of the daily summary, list them under **Your tools that start Claude Code sessions** in Settings › Jobs & schedule. Each has a name, and the folder its sessions run in, the words their first message starts with, or both. Their sessions then count as automated, not as your work. **Add a tool** adds one by hand; folders whose sessions look like a tool's are offered in one click. Assistants can list, add and remove them too.

The ingest switches (ingest new sources as they arrive, refresh pages whose sources changed) are under **Ingest** in Settings › AI assistants.

## Help

<a href="images/index.md#day-to-day"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/help-dark.png"><img alt="The help drawer on Tasks: its sections, the getting-started guides and the screen's keys" src="images/help-light.png"></picture></a>

Press `?` on any screen, click **?** on the top bar, or choose Help › Brainstead Help (⇧⌘?) for that screen's help in a drawer. Type to search every topic.

- **Getting started** has six step-by-step guides: Start here, Capture and write, Build the wiki, Find, GTD and Knowledge health.
- **Ask about Brainstead** puts a question to Ask, which [answers from the same help](ask.md#questions-about-brainstead).
- The keyboard shortcuts are in Help › Keyboard Shortcuts and in ⌘K.

## Settings

<a href="images/index.md#day-to-day"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/settings-general-dark.png"><img alt="Settings › General: the switch-over checklist (shown when the previous app's files are in the vault), the menu bar and Open at login, the capture shortcut, your name and appearance" src="images/settings-general-light.png"></picture></a>

Settings (⌘,) has General, Notes, Vault, AI assistants, Jobs & schedule, Capture extensions, Permissions and About. Press `?` on each for what's in it.

## In the background

- **The index.** Brainstead indexes the vault in a database outside it, so search and lists are instant. It picks up changes from other apps as they happen.
- **Safe writes.** Every save is all-or-nothing, keeps the file's line endings, and refuses if the file changed since it was read. Files that aren't UTF-8 open read-only.
- **Drafts.** Unsaved text is kept as a draft a second after you stop typing, and offered back after a crash.
- **Undo.** ⌘Z undoes the app's last five changes (a tick, a date, a clarified item, an assistant's change, a rename), even after a restart. In a note, ⌘Z undoes your typing.
- **`log.md` and Activity.** Brainstead records what it changes in the vault's `log.md`. **Activity** shows it with a heatmap of files changed by day, charts of your notes by type and tag, and the most linked notes.
- **The vault is yours.** Brainstead keeps only what you'd expect in the vault: notes, tasks, chats, the wiki and `log.md`. Settings, the index, drafts and name corrections live in `~/Library/Application Support/Brainstead/`.
